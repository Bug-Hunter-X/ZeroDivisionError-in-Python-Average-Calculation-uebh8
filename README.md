This repository demonstrates a common Python programming error: the ZeroDivisionError. The `bug.py` file contains code that calculates the average of a list of numbers but fails if the input list is empty.  The `bugSolution.py` file shows how to effectively handle empty lists to prevent this error. This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in your Python applications.
